This repository contains a few simple programs written with Yeti language, as a way for me to discover the language.

These programs are normally autonomous, i.e. they don't depend on any module besides Yeti standard modules.

Each file contains its own module and can be directly loaded in Yeti REPL, e.g.:

	load life

will start my implementation of famous Comway's game of life.
